# Lab 8

Today you will be implementing a simple interactive "game" wherein you click on a box and then it moves off to another random portion of the screen. The box should _only_ move if you click _within_ its confines.

I've set up some template code to get you started, and further instructions and details are available in the lab guide.

Some things to keep in mind:
 - The square should only move when you click within it
 - The new location of the square should be entirely within the window confines. No squares hanging partly outside the window!

 I couldn't write any tests for this lab, so just test it yourself by playing and then upload it back to here!
